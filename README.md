# Firebolt Benchmarks

In this repo, you’ll find the FireScale benchmark, as well as the benchmarking clients
and benchmark results that Firebolt has published. This includes the DDL and queries
for setting up and running FireScale on different vendors, as well as the results for
how various vendors performed on FireScale.

## Run FireScale Yourself

Firebolt has provided two clients in this repo: one written in Python, and one written
with Node.js with Grafana K6. The Python client is for power runs (executing one query
at a time in a sequential pattern) and for concurrency benchmarking with low expected
query throughput (<100 QPS). The K6 client is for benchmarking concurrent scenarios
with high query volumes and hundreds or thousands of queries being completed each second.

The Python client can be extended with benchmarks beyond just FireScale, though at this
time, only FireScale and TPCH queries are provided.

* [Python client](/clients/python/)
* [K6 client](/clients/k6/)

### Credentials

To connect to each data warehouse vendor, you need to provide a single credentials file located
at `config/credentials/credentials.json`. The expected format for this file is as follows:

```json
{
    "snowflake": {
        "account": "your_account",
        "user": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password",
        "database": "your_database",
        "schema": "your_schema",
        "warehouse": "your_warehouse"
    },
    "redshift": {
        "host": "your_cluster.region.redshift.amazonaws.com",
        "port": 5439,
        "database": "your_database",
        "user": "your_user",
        "password": "your_password"
    },
    "firebolt": {
        "account_name": "your firebolt account name",
        "database": "your_database",
        "engine_name": "your_engine",
        "auth": {
            "id": "your firebolt service account id",
            "secret": "your firebolt service account secret"
        }
    },
    "bigquery": {
        "project_id": "your_project_id",
        "dataset": "your_dataset",
        "key": "your json key generated from google cloud"
    }
}
```

Create your `credentials.json` file, paste this template in, and then fill in the
appropriate credentials for the vendors you wish to connect with. Please note that
if you have a different means of authenticating with these vendors, you may also
need to modify how the benchmarking clients handle authentication.

### Ingest Data

In order to load the data into each system, you will need to run the `setup.sql` scripts
present in the `/benchmarks` folder. You can do this manually in each vendor, or for ease,
the Python client can do this programmatically at the start of a benchmark run. For example,
to load data into Firebolt, configure your credentials, run:

```bash
/clients/python$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have other Python-based projects, it's recommended to do this with
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

Then run:

```bash
streamlit run /Firescale/benchmarks/clients/python/src/main.py
```

This will ingest the data and then kick off an initial benchmark power run.
